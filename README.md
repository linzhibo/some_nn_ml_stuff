## Generate a loooooooooooot of data with a little set of files and train a model with it

* in keras_model.py the **genData()** function allows to generate tons of data from **data/train** and **data/validation** folders, you can put what ever you want in it, make sure to rename properly the folder name. In this example, it trains digital number (unlike the MNIST dataset).
* run **keras_model.py** will generate lot of data and train the model from 0 to 9. and then you can detect digits from the traffic light if your country has it.
